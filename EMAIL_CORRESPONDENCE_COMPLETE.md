# 📧 EMAIL CORRESPONDENCE TRACKING - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## ✅ WHAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED

### 🎯 **Core Functionality**
The system now automatically saves generated and sent emails to the Supabase database, making them available for the chatbot to reference when users ask about email correspondence.

### 🏗️ **Database Integration**
1. **Enhanced Email Generation**: `/app/api/email/generate/route.ts`
   - Added optional `saveToDatabase` parameter
   - Automatically saves generated emails as drafts when requested
   - Preserves both markdown and HTML versions

2. **Email History API**: `/app/api/email/history/route.ts` (NEW)
   - Retrieves email history for specific clients
   - Combines data from both `emails` and `email_schedules` tables
   - Returns chronologically sorted results
   - Supports pagination with limit parameter

3. **Existing Email Storage**: Email send/schedule functions already save to database
   - `/app/api/email/send/route.ts` - saves sent emails
   - `/app/api/email/schedule/route.ts` - saves scheduled emails

### 🤖 **Chatbot Integration**
Enhanced `/app/ai/chat/route.ts` with:

1. **Intent Detection**: Recognizes email correspondence queries
   - Patterns: "email", "correspondence", "last email", "recent email", "email history"
   - New use case: `email_correspondence`

2. **Email History Fetching**: 
   - Automatically fetches recent emails when email-related queries detected
   - Retrieves from both `emails` and `email_schedules` tables
   - Includes subject, status, dates, and content previews

3. **Enhanced Context**: 
   - Adds `email_history` to the AI context bundle
   - Updated system prompt with email correspondence handling instructions
   - Specific guardrails for email correspondence use case

### 🔍 **Email Data Sources**
The system tracks emails from two main tables:

1. **`emails` table**: Direct send emails
   - Generated via email compose feature
   - Sent immediately or saved as drafts
   - Status: 'draft', 'queued', 'sent', 'failed'

2. **`email_schedules` table**: Scheduled/campaign emails  
   - Created via cadence scheduler
   - Automated email sequences
   - Status: 'pending', 'sent', 'failed', 'cancelled'

## 🚀 USAGE GUIDE

### **For Users**
1. **Generate emails** for clients using the email compose feature
2. **Send or schedule** emails - they're automatically saved to the database
3. **Ask the chatbot** about email correspondence:
   - "What was the last email sent to Tom Smith?"
   - "Show me recent email correspondence for this client"
   - "What emails have been sent to this client?"
   - "When was the last email sent?"

### **For Developers**
1. **API Endpoint**: `GET /api/email/history?clientId=xxx&limit=10`
2. **Email Generation**: Add `saveToDatabase: true` to save drafts
3. **Chat Integration**: Email history automatically included in context when needed
