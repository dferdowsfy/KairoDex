# Immediate Testing Guide - Word Document Issue

## 🚨 Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Test Your Word Document
```bash
cd backend
node test_word_processing.js ./uploads/your-file.docx
```

### Step 2: Check the Output
The script will tell you:
- ✅ If the file is a valid .docx
- ✅ If mammoth can extract text
- ❌ What specific errors occur

### Step 3: Based on Results

**If you see "Not a valid .docx":**
- Save your Word document as .docx format
- Make sure it's not corrupted
- Try a different Word document

**If you see "Mammoth extraction successful":**
- The backend should work fine
- Restart your backend server: `npm run dev`

**If you see "Mammoth extraction returned no content":**
- The file might be empty or password protected
- Copy and paste the content directly into the text area
