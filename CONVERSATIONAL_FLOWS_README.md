## üìã Usage Examples

### Contract Amendment Flow
```
User: "Change the purchase price to $450,000 and set earnest money to $5,000"
AI: Parses ‚Üí { purchase_price: 450000, earnest_money: 5000 }
System: Updates contract ‚Üí Sends to DocuSign ‚Üí Logs to blockchain
```

### Follow-Up Generation Flow
```
Context: Client viewed 3 properties last week, interested in downtown condos
AI: "Hi Sarah! Following up on the downtown condos we viewed. The market is moving fast - shall we schedule a second showing for the 15th floor unit you loved?"
```

### Showing Scheduling Flow
```
Input: Property "123 Main St", Date "2025-08-18", Time "Afternoon"
System: Checks calendar ‚Üí Suggests available slots ‚Üí Books showing ‚Üí Sends notifications
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns

### Event-Driven Actions
Each user interaction triggers backend events that update multiple systems:
```javascript
{
  "action": "send_email",
  "params": {
    "client_id": "<UUID>",
    "subject": "Follow-up",
    "body_text": "Generated message"
  }
}
```

### Chip-Based UI Navigation
Users navigate through flows using contextual action chips:
```javascript
{
  "id": "send_email",
  "label": "Send Email",
  "action": "send_email",
  "params": { "channel": "email" }
}
```

### Smart Context Management
The system maintains conversation context across interactions:
- Client preferences and history
- Property interests and viewing history
- Previous communications and sentiment
- Agent calendar and availability

## üîí Security & Compliance

### Data Protection
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Agents can only access their own data
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure API access with token validation
- **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Audit Logging**: Complete activity trail for compliance

### Privacy Controls
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary client information
- **Retention Policies**: Automatic cleanup of old interactions
- **Consent Management**: Clear opt-in/opt-out for communications
- **GDPR Compliance**: Right to access, modify, and delete data
