# Contract Amendment Feature Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### Frontend Enhancements (App.js)

1. **New State Variables**
   - `isContractAmendment`: Toggle for contract amendment mode
   - `amendmentInstruction`: Text area for amendment instructions
   - `amendedContract`: Stores AI-generated amended contract
   - `processingAmendment`: Loading state for amendment processing

2. **New UI Components**
   - Contract amendment checkbox in file upload section
   - Conditional instruction textarea (appears when checkbox is checked)
   - Updated dynamic button logic to handle amendment workflow
   - New Step 2 panel for displaying amended contracts with bold highlighting

3. **New Functions**
   - `handleContractAmendment()`: Processes contract amendments via AI
   - `handleSaveAmendedContract()`: Saves amended contracts to database
   - `resetContractAmendment()`: Resets amendment states

### Backend Enhancements (server.js)

1. **New API Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/contract-amendment`: Processes contract amendments using OpenAI
   - `POST /api/save-amended-contract`: Saves final amended contracts

2. **AI Integration**
   - Uses OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent contract analysis
   - Custom prompt for contract amendment tasks
   - Returns amended contracts with changes marked in **bold**

3. **Database Integration**
   - Logs amendment requests in `contract_amendments` table
   - Stores final contracts in `amended_contracts` table
   - Maintains audit trail of all amendment activities

### Database Schema (database_setup.sql)

1. **contract_amendments Table**
   - Logs all amendment requests for audit trail
   - Stores original contract, instruction, and AI result

2. **amended_contracts Table**
   - Stores final saved amended contracts
   - Links to agent and client for organization

3. **Security Features**
   - Row-level security enabled
   - Users can only access their own contracts
   - Proper indexing for performance

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### 1. Database Setup

Run the SQL commands in `database_setup.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of database_setup.sql
-- This creates the required tables and security policies
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Ensure your backend `.env` file has:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 3. Start the Application

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd frontend
npm start
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Endpoints

```javascript
// Process amendment
POST /api/contract-amendment
{
  "contract": "string",
  "instruction": "string", 
  "clientId": "string"
}

// Save amended contract
POST /api/save-amended-contract
{
  "clientId": "string",
  "originalContract": "string",
  "amendedContract": "string",
  "instruction": "string"
}
```

### AI Prompt Structure

```
You are a contract amendment assistant. Given the following contract and instruction, return an updated version with only the changed sections. Make changed text bold using Markdown.
